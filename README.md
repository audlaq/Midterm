Midterm
=======
This program uses the New York Times Congress API to allow users to find either their US Senators or US House Representative.

Users are asked to choose which they'd like to search for and are then asked to input a state.
The program will then either return the 2 US Senators from that state or will ask for a district
and will then return the US House Representative from that district.
